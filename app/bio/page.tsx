          Rovenskaya began her artistic journey at an early age, driven by a deep passion for history, particularly the Post-Soviet Graffiti movement. During the late-Soviet period, Russia's subcultural youth turned to graffiti as a rebellious medium, expressing their ideologies through art. These graffiti artists aimed to penetrate government-controlled public spaces with symbols of love, peace signs, and evocative quotes, using materials like chalk, oil paint, and spray paint. Saint Petersburg became a significant canvas for this movement, transforming into one of the world's most iconic symbols of rebellion.

          Financial challenges led Rovenskaya to leave high school, a decision that allowed her to fully immerse herself in creative endeavors, including writing songs and poems. As a freelancer for local musicians, she drew inspiration from diverse cultures, infusing her work with powerful themes of love and freedom. Her rebellious nature drove her to blend her passions for street art and music, ultimately pioneering a distinctive pop art technique characterized by free brush strokes with acrylic and oil paints. This unique style has earned her widespread international recognition.
